## Introduction
The Intruder Detection System is a wireless security solution designed to detect unauthorized access to a designated area. Utilizing a grid of pressure sensors and a geophone sensor, the system provides real-time alerts to ensure safety and security in residential and commercial environments.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Wireless communication using MQTT protocol
- Utilizes pressure sensors and geophone sensor for accurate detection
- Easy installation and setup
- User-friendly interface for monitoring and control

## Hardware Requirements
- Pressure sensors (as many as needed for the grid)
- Geophone sensor
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32)
- Power supply (batteries or USB power)
- Jumper wires and a breadboard (for prototyping)
- Optional: enclosure for housing the components

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (for microcontroller programming)
- MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
- Any MQTT client for monitoring (e.g., MQTT.fx, MQTT Explorer)
- Libraries:
  - PubSubClient for MQTT
  - Adafruit Sensor libraries (if using specific sensors)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intruder-detection-system.git
   cd intruder-detection-system
